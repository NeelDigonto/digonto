Relax! You have come to the the right place. 
<br/>
No matter what you are trying to achieve, a simple scalable frontend, 
an API server or a complex service mesh behemoth with Machine Learning pipeline and all the glory? I have got you covered.
<br/>
We will also look at GitOps & AWS best practises, by deploying a production grade CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions 
and using terraform for setting up a resilient infrastructure.
<br/>

This guide if meant for beginers and seasoned developers alike. Beginers will start with best practises in the industry, and
more advanced users can take a look at the implmentation of latest tech like karpenter for AWS EKS and so on.
